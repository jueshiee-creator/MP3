I don't want to wake, I don't want to sleep
我不想醒来，但也不想睡去
I don't want to suffocate, I don't want to breathe
我不想窒息，可也不想呼吸
I don't want to drown, I don't want to sink
我不想淹死，但也不想沉没
Deep, deep down to the bottom of the sea
下沉，一点点下沉到海底
The top of the mountain, snow on the peak
山顶上覆盖着层层积雪
*****, I'm the creak in the floor when I creep
贱女人，我爬行前进的时候地板会吱吱作响
Teenage witch, I don't need a *****
你是乳臭未干的巫女，我不需要女人在身边
I don't want a chain, I don't need a whip
我不要铁链，我也不要皮鞭
Still gettin' cash, still flickin' ash
我的钱源源不尽，但还是一片灰烬
See you actin' hard and I can't hold back
我看你演得这么虚伪，我妨碍不了你
I need you to know, I don't want to see
我要你明白，但我不想知道
I don't want to hear you talkin' bout me
我不想听见你谈论关于我的任何事
